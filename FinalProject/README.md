# Final Project: Battleship

## What is Battleship?
Battleship is a strategy type guessing game for two players. It is played on ruled grids (paper or board) on which each players fleet of ships (including battleships) are marked. The locations of the fleets are concealed from the other player. Players alternate turns calling shots at the other players ships, and the objective of the game is to destroy the opposing players fleet.

## Objective
A new version will be created in the C language. This project is part of our "Producto Integrador del Aprendizaje". It is about recreating the Battleship game in order to test our knowledge in the C language. The project was done individually with 100% original code, only looking for some information to know how to perform some functions.

## How to play
1. You have to defeat your opponent by destroying all his war ships before he destroys yours.
2. You have a fleet of N battle ships
3. The turn is chosen to see who will play first and it is shown above whose turn it is
4. After the ships are placed, you can attack the enemy area. To attack a specific area, enter its x and y coordinate(separated by a space or ,)
5. If your attack hits the enemy ship, the new board will be shown and it will be denoted by an 'X' and your turn continues.
6. If your attack misses, the new board will be shown and it will be denoted by a 'o' and your turn ends.
7. And now the opponent's turn will follow 

The first to shoot down the entire enemy fleet wins

## Self-evaluation
1. Complexity 2 (It is not very complicated, but it is not easily done either)
2. Functionality 3 (Works perfectly)
3. Code 3 (I put it together in a very showy and very organized way, so that it is easily understood)
4. Storage 2 (Stores the boards of each player in addition to their view and I use stdio for reasonable tasks in the right way cleaning the inputs)
5. Documentation 3 (I do not think I have spelling errors and the video complies with what is requested)
