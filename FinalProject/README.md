# Final Project: Battleship


Battleship is a strategy type guessing game for two players. It is played on ruled grids (paper or board) on which each players fleet of ships (including battleships) are marked. The locations of the fleets are concealed from the other player. Players alternate turns calling shots at the other players ships, and the objective of the game is to destroy the opposing players fleet.
