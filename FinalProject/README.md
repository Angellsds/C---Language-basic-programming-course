# Final Project: Battleship


Battleship is a strategy type guessing game for two players. It is played on ruled grids (paper or board) on which each players fleet of ships (including battleships) are marked. The locations of the fleets are concealed from the other player. Players alternate turns calling shots at the other players ships, and the objective of the game is to destroy the opposing players fleet.

A new version will be created in this project and is part of our professional programming training program. It is about recreating the Battleship game in order to test our knowledge in the C language. The project was done individually with 100% original code, only looking for some information to know how to perform some functions.

# What does it take to do it?
- Function to set the field
- Function to show the field
- Function to choose randomly a player to play first
- Function to check if someone win
- Function to generate the ships
- Function to attack

# How to play
1. You have to defeat your opponent by destroying all his war ships before he destroys yours.
2. You have a fleet of N battle ships
3. The turn is chosen to see who will play first and it is shown above whose turn it is
4. After the ships are placed, you can attack the enemy area. To attack a specific area, enter its x y coordinate(separated by a space or ,)
5. If your attack hits the enemy ship, the new board will be shown and it will be denoted by an 'X' and your turn ends.
6. If your attack misses, the new board will be shown and it will be denoted by a 'o' and your turn ends.
7. And now the opponent's turn will follow 

The first to shoot down the entire enemy fleet wins
